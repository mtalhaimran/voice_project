# voice_project

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Provide your OpenAI API key in the sidebar when prompted.

### Voice features

You can ask questions by recording your voice directly in the browser or by uploading an audio file (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`). The app transcribes your voice with OpenAI's speech-to-text and replies with both text and an audio answer.
